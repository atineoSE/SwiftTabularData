 # Explore and manipulate data in Swift with TabularData
 This Xcode playground is based on the [tech talk of the same name](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/10100) by Alejandro Isaza and David Findlay, both ML Software Engineers at Apple.
 
 TabularData was introduced in 2021 as a new framework for macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
 
 It helps us to explore and manipulate **unstructured data**, the kind of data that hasn't been prearranged in a predefined manner, such as weather data or population statistics.
 
 There are 2 major activities we can perform on a new data set of unstructured data:
 - üîç Exploration: What are the values? What are the types? How is the data represented? Are there missing values?
 - üõ† Manipulation: Transforming the data set to a format better suited to the problem we are trying to solve.
