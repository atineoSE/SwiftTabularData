 # Explore and manipulate data in Swift with TabularData
 This Xcode playground is based on the [tech talk of the same name ](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/10100) by Alejandro Isaza and David Findlay, both ML Sotware Engineers at Apple.
 
 TabularData is a new framework available for macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS.
 
 It helps us to explore and manipulate **unstructured data**, the kind of data that hasn't been prearranged in a predefined manner, such as weather data or population statistics.
 
 There are 3 major activities we can perform on a new data set of unstructured data:
 - üîç exploration: what are the values? what are the types? how is the data represented? are there missing values?
 - üõ† manipulation: transforming the data set to a format better suited to the problem we are trying to solve
